Programming assignments and quizzes from all courses in the Coursera [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by `deeplearning.ai`.

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Credits

This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base, and diagrams are taken from the [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), unless specified otherwise.

## Programming Assignments

### Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Disclaimer

I recognize the hard time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are **only for reference**. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. Please do not copy any part of the code as is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). This course is the most straight-forward deep learning course I have ever taken, with fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure by the `deeplearning.ai` team.
